                        Eye contact with O'Brien is Winston's first indication that
                        something may be amiss within the party. It gives him hope
                        that he may not be forever resigned to this fate.

                        The only concrete proof that the party changes information
                        of the past that Winston has ever seen is the photo of Rutherford.
                        He feels that if he knows this, surely others will also figure it out
                        soon and there can be a revolution.

                        Finding the room above the shop gives Winston a place where he feels
                        safe from the party. He knew it would be risky, given that it would be a crime
                        against the party to have private thoughts, so he had to take time to consider the decision.

                        pleasure.
                        He also got the book from the meeting, so he could learn more about the history of the plan to
                        dismantle
                        the party.

                        Reading the book enlightened Winston as to how he could actually

                        the book said that the power to overthrow the party lay in the Proletariats.

                        Getting caught by the thought police is the start of the downfall of Winston's plan.
                        Naturally, when an all powerful dictatorship catches on to your plan to overthrow it
                        they tend to be unhappy. Getting caught also seperates Winston from Julia, which kept Winston
                        away
                        from the one reason he was still fighting.

                        Winston betraying Julia marked the end of Winston's fight. Up until this point,
                        even after being tortured mercilessly by the party, Winston had still kept fighting
                        because of his love for Julia. By giving up Julia, he gave up his reason to keep fighting.
                        after this, he no longer resists the torture and mind control from Winston.
